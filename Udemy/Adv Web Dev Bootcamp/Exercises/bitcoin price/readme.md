# Bitcoin Price

The goal of this exercise is to build a simple application that gets the price of bitcoin on page load, and then refreshes that price at the click of a button. This just continues to hammer in AJAX with raw xhr.

## Starter Code

### Html

```html
<h1>Bitcoin Current Price is: <span id="price"></span></h1>

<button>Refresh Data</button>
```

### Css

```css
span {
  color: green;
}
```
