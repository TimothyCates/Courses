# Colored Boxes

The goal of this project is to create a CRA (create react app) application of a div containing 300 colored squares. Every 300 miliseconds a random square is choses and its color should change. Ideally this project would include everything learned so far, class componenets, stateless fuctional componenets, state, and props. There is no starter code outside of the CRA boiler plate.
