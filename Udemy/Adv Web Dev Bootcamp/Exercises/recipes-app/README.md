# Recipe App

This is a react application using CRA (Create-React-App). This application will be using the older class based components rather than hooks, and is intended to be a first foray into React, and the ecosystem. The problem with this app is mainly that it will use some dated technologies but in the pursuit of simply re-learning react this project will use these technologies regardless.

## App Details

As the name suggests this app is a recipe holder of some kind. It will contain Images of the finished dish, the required items, and the steps to produce the dish.
