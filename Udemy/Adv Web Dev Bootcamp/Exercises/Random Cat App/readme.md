# Random Image App

This is identical to the random dog app but this time, it's using jquery, not my *ideal* library but practice is practice, and it will serve as a good refresher

## Starter Code

Colt did not give me any starter code so I did a simple modification to the earlier dog picture app.

### Html

```html
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Welcome To Random Cat Pictures</h1>
        <img id="photo" src="https://purr.objects-us-east-1.dream.io/i/dsc_0002.jpg" alt="">
        <button id="btn">Get Random Cat!</button>
    </div>
```

### Css

```css
img {
  height: 200px;
}

.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

button {
  margin: 20px;
}
```
