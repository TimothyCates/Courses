# Fullstack Todo App

The goal of this application is to combine everything we have learned so far to create our first Fullstack react app. We will be re-creating the todo api we did in a previous exercise, we will then combine that with a front-end react app that consumes that api to allow the user to add, remove, complete, and edit todo's.
