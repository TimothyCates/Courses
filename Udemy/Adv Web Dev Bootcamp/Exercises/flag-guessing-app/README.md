# Flag Guessing App

The goal of this project is to use ComponentDidMount (which we did in the last project anyway). We will be pinging a restful api that gives us data on countries. We will use the fact that they store png/svg's of flags to create a very simple game where you are given a flag and four choices, you guess and are told if you guessed correctly or not. Clicking next resets the 'game.'
