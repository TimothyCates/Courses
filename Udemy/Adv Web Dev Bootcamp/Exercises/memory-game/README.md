# Memory Game

The goal of this project is to create a simple memory game. The navbar should have a new game button that resets the game at any time. THe game should consist of X pairs of cards, they will start face up, after three seconds the cards will then flip over and the user will attempt to make matches. Upon clicking a card it shows its face, when two cards of the same type are clicked they stay faced up, otherwise they will flip back over to hide the face.
