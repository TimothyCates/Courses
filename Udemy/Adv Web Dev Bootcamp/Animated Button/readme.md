# Animated Button Follow-Along
This is just a place for me to place the code of following Colt, making the button. This mostly serves as active practice and won't be of interest or importance other than for myself.

## Starter Code
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,400" rel="stylesheet">

<h1>This Button Does Nothing</h1>
<button class="btn">Click Me</button>
```
